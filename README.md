FOR Exams refer the Programs and UMLs in [Manuals](https://github.com/vivekhathwar/OOADP/tree/master/Manual) folder.

This repository contains the .mdj files (class diagrams) and .java (functions) of implemented examples for few basic Design Patterns dicovered by GoF.

***BELOW PROGRAMS ARE ONLY FOR REFERENCE, WRITING IN EXAMS IS NOT SUGGESTED***
1) ```Fighters``` and ```Payment``` are exempler implementation for ***Strategy design pattern***.
2) ```Bridge is``` ***Bridge design pattern*** implementation of Workshop-Vehicle.
3) ```Home Theatre``` is a ***Facade design pattern*** implementation.
4) ```Factory``` is ***Abstract Factory Design*** of two level abstraction for an imaginary company with 12 products of 6 categories.
    
    The other example with a single level abstraction (As given in Textbook) is ```AbstractFactory2```.
5) ```Adapter``` is ***Adapter Design Pattern*** of drawing 3 different shapes(This example is ***class adapter pattern***).
    • Object Adapter pattern— The adpter relies on one object (the adapting object) containing another (the adapted object).
    • Class Adapter pattern—Another way to implement the Adapter pattern is with multiple inheritance. In this case, it is 
    called a Class Adapter pattern.
    Another example is ```MediaPlayerAdapter```.
6) ```Bridge_textBook_example``` is a ***Bridge Design Pattern*** example given in the textbook.
